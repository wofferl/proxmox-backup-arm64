The proxmox-backup*,promox-mini-journalreader and pve-xtermjs packages are cross build using the source from https://git.proxmox.com/ with the build.sh script and the github action docker buildx workflow. The other arch independent packages were downloaded from http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pbs/dists/bullseye/pbs-no-subscription/binary-amd64/.
