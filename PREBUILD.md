_These are unofficial binary packages of Proxmox Backup Server 3.x for debian/bullseye._

**Please keep in mind that version 3.x is originally developed for debian/bookworm and it can happen at any time that a future version breaks the dependencies for debian/bullseye and can no longer be built.**

The proxmox-backup*,promox-mini-journalreader and pve-xtermjs packages are cross build using the source from https://git.proxmox.com/ with the build.sh script and the github action docker buildx workflow. The other arch independent packages were downloaded from http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pbs/dists/bullseye/pbs-no-subscription/binary-amd64/.

Use at your own risk.
